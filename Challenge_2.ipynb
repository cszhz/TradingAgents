    "# Building Multi-Agent Investment Firms with Strands SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **Challenge 2** of the AWS re:Invent Jam! In this challenge, you'll build a sophisticated multi-agent investment analysis system using the Strands Agents SDK. This system mirrors the collaborative dynamics of real-world investment firms, where different specialists work together to make informed trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll create an AI-powered investment research team consisting of:\n",
    "- **Bull Researcher**: An optimistic analyst focused on growth opportunities and positive market factors\n",
    "- **Bear Researcher**: A cautious analyst specializing in risk identification and market threats\n",
    "- **Research Manager**: A senior decision-maker who synthesizes insights from both perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building the AI backbone for a modern investment firm. Your system needs to:\n",
    "1. **Analyze Market Data**: Process financial information and news to understand market conditions\n",
    "2. **Generate Diverse Perspectives**: Create both bullish and bearish investment cases\n",
    "3. **Facilitate Structured Debates**: Allow agents to challenge and refine each other's arguments\n",
    "4. **Synthesize Final Decisions**: Combine multiple viewpoints into actionable investment recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Learning Objectives\n",
