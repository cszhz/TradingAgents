      "1. **Trend Confirmation:** The price is above both the 50 SMA and 200 SMA, confirming an uptrend. The 10 EMA further supports this with its upward trajectory.\n",
      "2. **Momentum:** The MACD and MACD histogram indicate positive momentum, though the histogram suggests a slight slowdown.\n",
      "3. **Entry Points:** Consider entering long positions if the price approaches the lower Bollinger Band (212.3090) for potential support.\n",
      "4. **Exit Strategy:** Set a stop-loss below the lower Bollinger Band or use the ATR value (4.9341) to determine a suitable stop-loss level.\n",
      "5. **Risk Management:** Given the moderate volatility indicated by the ATR, adjust position sizes accordingly to manage risk.\n",
